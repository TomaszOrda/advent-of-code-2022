A record of my solutions for 2022 [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022 "AoC").

Solutions for each day and task are in separate files. The solutions are quite old, and will require some reworking. Thus I will be adding them slowly. Also I plan on solving the tasks I havent had time for back in 2022.

To run the solution create a file `Day_n.txt` with the input pasted in. Then run the `.py` file.

Data for each task can be accessed through the site.
