A record of my solutions for 2022 [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022 "AoC").

Solutions for each day and task are in separate files. To run the solution, create a file `Day_n.txt` with the input pasted in. Then run the `.py` file. Data for each task can be accessed through the AoC site.

I have attended AoC in 2022. I did not manage to earn all the stars — only 44, mostly because I wanted to spend one day for each task during the event, and haven't had much motivation redoing the missing days after.

Old solutions were not as pretty as I'd like. Thus I had to rewrite every one of them.

Stars I got in 2022 are denoted by ⭐. All the other stars were obtained during creation of this repository.
